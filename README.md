# QR Code Attendance Registry System Case Study in the University 

Summary
Quick Response (QR) code-based attendance registry system records
attendance automatically with the use of QR scan. The system generates and scans QR code, evaluates the attendance eligibility of a student and presents up-to-date reports. Data are stored in a database and applies Data Analytics with
the use of retrieved attendance data and external dataset. Insertions, deletions and changes of data in the system can be done straightforward via the designed
GUI. The system coordinates with a mobile application as an alternative or additional equipment to be used in the case the primary tool (Laptop) is not available.

The current target users of this project are Professors who teaches second-year students.

Information such as the professor’s handled subjects, schedules and student’s full name and student number, information that the professors already have in hand is needed input for the application.
